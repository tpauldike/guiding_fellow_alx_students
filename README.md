# The Journey of an **ALX** Newbie
## About the Repository
The repository is about giving tips and hints that will inspire, motivate and guide my fellow ALX Software Engineering students, based on certain principles and personal experiences, hoping to be the reason why someone out there did not give up on venturing into the tech industry and solving real life problems.
In this repository are different articles or piece of writings that answers certain questions that I've been frequently asked by peers

It might interest you to know that I also have [this playlist on Youtube]() where I upload some motivating videos from my personal experience, just to make it sink into your sub-consciousness that; "if [Topman](https://github.com/tpauldike) could do it, you too can do it".

Enrolling for the program with zero knowledge of coding or programming is not at all a reason to give up and say that you cannot do it, *I did it; you can!*.

## Contents of the Repository
I ordered the contents of the repository by having them numbered from 0, using numbers in base 16 (0 - f) as the prefixes of the names.

The articles or piece of writings are as follows:
### 0. [How to Tackle ALX Projects](./0-tackling_alx_projects)
Here, I exposed the things I learned, thinking it could be helpful to someone out there. I'm aware that the same thing may not work for all of us, but then, life is governed by principles.
