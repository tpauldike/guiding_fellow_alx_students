# How to Tackle ALX Projects
![tackling_alx_projects](https://github.com/tpauldike/rough_work/blob/main/designs/tackling_alx_projects.png)
## Preamble
Here are some of my strategies and how I am able to thrive. I don't know it all, I don't get the chance to always implement these, but I've found out, from personal experience, that being principled works. The following are my recommended way of tackling ALX projects.
## Ten Steps Highlighted
### 1. Look at the General Objectives
![project_general_objectives](https://github.com/tpauldike/rough_work/blob/main/screenshots/G_objectives.png)
The ALX Software Engineering program is well planned, such that; everything you see on the intranet has a meaning and a purpose; if you learn how to follow, you will accomplish a lot, beyond beating deadlines and passing the checkers.
Pay attention to what have been stated on the intranet as the things you are expected to learn while doing the project. Stop being unnecessarily frightened, face your fears and they will gradually vanish. Focus on what you want to achieve, not on how big the challenge is, take one step at a time.

### 2. Study and Learn New Things
There may never be a time when you'll stop feeling like what you have to learn is very much bigger than what you have learned, but always make good attempts to keep learning by breaking the big problem into simpler parts and grasping as much as you can within the short time.

Study with rapt attention. Do not dwell on the part that appears very confusing and makes you feel like you're lagging behind or not good enough to be in the program. As you study, get carried away practicing, that is if you have enough time.

When I say practice, I don't mean ALX projects, do something else, don't even look at the projects by this time, it might distract you from learning. Learning is very different from earining good scores. That's why we have people who have very high average scores in ALX submitting to people with lower average scores for mentorship.

### 3. Assess Yourself at Intervals, using the Learning Objectives
The 70 - 100 hours per week is real, I really spend such time studying and coding but not always, sometimes I can spend very few hours in a day because I have learned how to overcome unnecessary pressures. One can spend 10 hours per day and still acheive what should have been acheive in 2 hours; yes, it's terrible but it happens when that one does not utilize the time properly or when he/she lacks proper guide.

Apart from being disciplined (avoiding chats, gists and other distractions), one has to be objective, knowing what he/she wants to acheive within the time and going for it, even when it's frightening and seems impossible or hard to acheive. Managing the time well is learned, and *you learn how to manage time by managing time*.

Remember to not bother about the project by this time, just be learning and be checking the learning objectives whether you've met all of them or most of them; solve 'non-ALX' tasks with what you learn while studying.

According to [Topman Paul-Dike](https://github.com/tpauldike);
>*We learn by doing; if you cannot do it, you've not learned it*

### 4. Source for Different *(Non-ALX) Materials*
At the early stage of the program, you may learn everything that will help you do some projects from the resource materials provided on the intranet, such that, if you find any part of the project difficult, you might go back to the materials and read them and understand what you're missing. **But**, that experience does not continue; you will surely get to the point where reading ALX resource materials feels like a waste of time (it actually isn't).

I know how it feels to read the entire materials only to discover that they only helped you to pass the evaluation quiz and then the main project looked totally strange, as though you did not read at all.
At this point, just take it that you are now perceived as learned enough to be able to source for resource materials online (by yourself) that will help you learn and solve the tasks. Most times you do not need to read all those materials that are made available for you; following the learning objectives will make you know what you should read or what video you should see

If, by this time, you haven't seen the main project tasks, you will be enjoying your studies and really learning new things practically. The reason certain persons prefer a 4 minute YouTube video tutorial to the one with the duration of about an hour or more is that they are more interested in solving ALX tasks than they are interested in learning, because they feel that the time constraints and the release of new projects almost daily makes it too hard; it's a natural tendency, and I've been there in my days of confusion as a newbie. I appreciate the fact that the time alloted to each project is small, but inside you is the software engineer that you're yet to know, be tougher than the toughest situation there can be in ALX SE.

### 5. Dare to Take the Evaluation Quiz on Your Own
![4_errors](https://github.com/tpauldike/rough_work/blob/main/screenshots/submit_answers.png)
Let the evaluation quiz for the project show how much you understand about some of the basic concepts of the topic(s) covered in the project. In order not to get into the trouble of answering all the quiz and not being able to identify the one that was not correctly answered, do this:
- Answer no. 0
- Scroll down and click the `submit answers` button to confirm that you answered no. 0 correctly before you answer the next one

For example, if you have 5 quiz questions, they will be numbered from 0 to 4, when you answer question 0 and click on submit, if you're answer is wrong, the error message will be `5 errors`, but if your answer was correct, it will show `4 errors`, then you answer question 1 and click the button again to get `3 errors` before you proceed to the next question, just like that. If you find any one hard, take note of it, skip it and answer others and come back for it later, at least you know the exact quiz question(s) that you didn't supply the correct answer(s) to; then do your Google search or ask peers.

### 6. Start the Project
![general_requirement](https://github.com/tpauldike/rough_work/blob/main/screenshots/G_requirement.png)
First of all, pay attention to all or most of the instructions written on the intranet in the **General Requirement** section. Nothing on the intranet is for fancy.

This is the point where you have to be biased in the rest of your research, because at this time, you now understand what the project requires of you (to an extent) but probably do not know exactly how to implement it or solve the questions, especially after getting the easiest tasks (maybe 0 and 1) done. You can't help being project-minded at this point, because your problem now is that your checkers should be all green. Be proud of yourself, if you were able to solve one task out of five tasks, it's motivating, although it might take you some time.

Enjoy the pressure and adapt to it, do not let it weigh you down; ALX projects will usually not feel easy, honestly. Be conscious of the fact that; *if you passed the checkers and couldn't reproduce the results shown as examples on the intranet, you did not learn it*.

### 7. Try Every Means but Don't Cheat Yourself
Our codes are not hidden and I believe that it is no offense to look at someone else's codes on GitHub. You just might find what you've been getting wrong, if you've really put in your best; do not wait until you're exhausted before you do this. Discipline yourself to not cheat yourself. Try to understand what is making that person's code work and try to reproduce the same result, re-write the codes on your own, this is something you cannot do if you didn't study.

You put your carreer and future in danger when you resort to cheating yourself, copying codes that you don't know how they came about, pasting them and having great scores. Sometimes, overlook the project deadlines and just learn and stop feeling like all your peers are better than you, they are all feeling the hardness of the program, even the ones that were already software engineers before they enrolled in the program.

This stuff is not easy; although, I strongly believe that they are easy things made hard. I know some good folks in the ALX SE program who copied at some point in the program. The amazing thing now is that if you confront these men now, they can explain exactly what the codes are doing and rewrite most of them from the scratch, by themselves. So, if they don't tell you, you may never suspect that they pushed someone else's codes in this life, because they dared to learn and learn and learn. And now they're so good, solving real life problems.

You are the only one you can cheat, do not cheat yourself and deprive yourself of the foundational knowledge that the program is designed to make you have. Any aid that will make you not really learn the thing does not mean well for you.

### 8. Reachout to Others for Help
If you get stuck, ask your peers, the program was not design for you to do it alone. Ask, and after asking, ask again, and after asking again, still ask again. Ask different persons, stop avoiding being a fool for some few seconds, don't be scared of being called the one lagging behind. Forget your age and be submissive to anyone who has something you're looking for, you may have to take some insults as well.

The 3 set of persons you should ask are:
- fellow cohort members
- senior cohort members
- ALX mentors for your cohort

But before you ask any of these persons, ensure that you:
1. show respect for their time, do not feel entitled to their help.
2. do not feel like you're bugging them, every good fellow will always want to help you out.
3. make your best efforts to learn the basic concepts and to get the task done.
4. state the project and the task, don't give your helper that assignment.
5. present the problem, what you have tried that did not work, and the error(s) you're getting.

And stop thinking that someone knows it just because he is in a senior cohort, that mindset will frustrate you. You may know something that someone in a earlier cohort does not know. Even the ALX mentors do not know it all. Everyone is learning. Have that mindset of "we are learning together, and I could be of help to this my helper one day".

### 9. Dare to Make PLD (Peer Learning Day) Sessions Work
Teach the little you know, even when you're not through with your project, no one will punish you for not knowing it all, or for making some mistakes while teaching. Stop waiting for someone else to make the first move, that's why several buddy groups are inactive, it takes courage to lead your peers. You'll be amazed how someone that knows more than you do but lacks the confidence or the opportunity (due to time constraints) to lead will join your session and correct some of the things you're saying or make some contributions that will make you learn more. And you might as well be so surprised at the number of persons that are much more confused than you are, who will start seeing a saviour in you already.

Now, it doesn't have to be a formal PLD session, you can just teach anyone and anything, the **Feyman Learning Technique** really works. Just teach it. Answer questions on WhatsApp groups, Slack, Telegram or wherever your peers are found, help your peers out when they're looking for the help that you can give and even the help that you think you cannot give. Fight lack of confidence by taking the 'scary' bold steps.

### 10. Rest While Working
Deliberately take some break, especially when you feel frustrated. Don't give the negative thoughts that space in your heart. You will not feel good at such times but some break will really help. Do something else, maybe a hobby, and return later to the work. If you find yourself angry with ALX and her structure, it's normal, just go and rest and forget about the work for a while, but come back to it later.

## Conclusion
ALX is very detailed, pay attention to every detail, otherwise you'll waste your time looking for a solution that might be on the intranet there, looking at you. Don't just jump into solving project tasks, if you really want to learn.

Celebrate your small wins. Set your priorities right. Be disciplined and diligent. When you feel overwhelmed, take a small part of the problem and get it solved and take another small part and continue solving. Missing first and second deadlines doesn't mean failure, don't be scared of missing them *sometimes "while you're learning **(if you're learning)**"*

Lastly, **ATTEND LIVE LEARNING SESSIONS & WALK-IN SESSIONS** whether or not you understand what they are talking there, just be attentive.

If you've got enough time to play some audio (on the go, or with rapt attention), I explained some of these things on [this Twitter space](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MnGnpEbDlVxO)

I also have on YouTube a video titled: [How I Stayed Motivated...](https://youtu.be/FESA5HIAaeg), you may want to watch it to get fired up.
